# Credit Card Approval
The aim is to construct a binary classification model capable of predicting credit approval decisions for individual customers

### Motivation
effectively utilizing these attributes to ascertain whether a customer's credit application should be sanctioned or declined

### Libraries Used
  - sklearn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib


To install the above packages using pip, use command
```$pip install package-name```

### Files Description
- /content/Credit_Card_Applications.csv: This is the dataset file for the project
- The initial dataset has been analysed on Tableau as well at https://public.tableau.com/profile/akshit.arora8313#!/
- Data is downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval
- CreditApproval.ipynb: The jupyter notebook which includes the analysis and modeling
- The project also includes a front-end webiste which can be deloyed using flask app and will provide with "Approved" or "Not Approved" status on entering all the parameters
- For the front-end refer to the folder Credit Card Approval, first run the model.py and then the app.py file

### Usage
  - Run the google colab notebook CredictCardApproval.ipynb

### Summary
In this project, I have tried to find out the factors that are most important for getting an 
approval for the Australian credit Approval through the power of Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 
Though we have achieved 86% of accuracy, we also tried to check if we can improve the 
performance further and tried decision tree. 
However, 86% is the best we could get from this data using both the model; 
logistic regression and random forest
