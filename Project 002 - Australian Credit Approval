### Australian Credit Approval
Constructing a binary classification model capable of predicting credit approval decisions for individual customers

### Liberies Used
sklearn
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib

### Files Description
/content/Credit_Card_Applications.csv: This is the dataset file for the project
CreditApproval.ipynb: The google colab notebook which includes the analysis and modeling

### Usage
Run the google colab notebook AustralianCredictApproval.ipynb

### Summary
In this project, I have tried to find out the factors that are most important for getting an approval or rejection for the credit card
through the power of Data Analysis and Machine Learning. I used three (3) different models to carry out my project, out of the three,
I found out that Random Forest Classifier gave uptimum result of 89% accuarate score, 87% precision score and 88% f1 score, while 
Logistic Regression gave the highest value of 93% recall score. These are the models used to improve of our data. However, 93% recall score,
89% accuracy score, 88% f1 score, 87% precision score, is the best we could get from this data using these models; logistic regression and
random forest classifier and decision tree classifier.
